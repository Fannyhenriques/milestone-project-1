                Hospitable Stockholm is a cozy, family-style restaurant created by two lifelong friends Amy and Isabel
                with years of
                experience in the restaurant world. Our focus is on delicious food, great wine, and a warm, friendly
                atmosphere, all while keeping sustainability at the heart of what we do.
            </p>

                We work with farmers and importers who share our sustainable values, and our menu changes daily to
                reflect the seasons and available ingredients. Every dish is crafted from scratch, inspired by
                traditional Swedish comfort food with influences from across Europe.

                Come by for a carefully crafted cocktail at the bar with some of our classic snacks, or enjoy a full
                evening at our “Spritbordet,” where we pair each dish with playful cocktails for a fun, interactive
                dining experience. Creativity, craftsmanship, and care are at the center of everything we do, making
                every visit special.
